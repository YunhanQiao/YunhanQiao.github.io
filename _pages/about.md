<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Yunhan Qiao. I am a second-year Ph.D. student supervised by Prof. Christopher Hundhausen at Oregon State University. Before that, I earned my M.S. in Software Engineering from Arizona State University, supervised by Dr. Robert Likamwa. I have been working in the software engineering field for seven years.

My research interests include human-computer interaction, specifically how AI assistance tools (e.g., Copilot) can improve the efficiency of software engineering tasks without sacrificing comprehension of coding.

**Program Comprehension of Integration Tasks using Copilot:**
![Workflow](/assets/images/yunhan-qiao.jpg)
Generative AI(GenAI) offers new opportunities to support programming in various ways. For example, Copilot has been shown to enhance productivity in software development significantly. When assessing the quality of code generated by Copilot, results have indicated that it is a promising tool for solving basic programming tasks. Moreover, studies have found no significant differences in the performance of Copilot across different programming languages. Additionally, Copilot solved most programming tasks after just a second prompt adjustment. Regarding readability, the code produced by Copilot is comparable to that written by human programmers working in pairs. While Copilot has proven effective at solving basic programming tasks, it is unclear whether Copilot can be successfully leveraged to help developers with code comprehension. Given that novices struggle with AI-generated code due to their poorly crafted prompts, which can increase their frustration levels. we speculate that they would also have trouble constructing prompts to help them comprehend existing code. Based on this motivation, we try to explore if the quality of the prompt is going to influence the program comprehension, and further influence the task completion.
